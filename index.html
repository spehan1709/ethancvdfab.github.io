                    This is where I will be documenting my progress in SP's Digital Fabrication & Prototyping Fundementals Elective module(EP1000).
                    Here you will find info about me, my journey of learning in DFAB and later on, my final project.

                    In DFAB, I will be learning about safety in FabLab, using software tools and webpage development, 3D modelling, 3D printing, laser cutting, electronics, and programming.
                    This will culminate in a final project that involves all the skills I have learnt.

                                    I am Ethan, a year 1 Diploma of Applied Chemistry (DAPC) student at SP. I enjoy playing FPS games and video editing.
                                    I have basic experience with programming and designing products and I would like to use my journey in DFAB to deepen my 
                                    skills. I am still new to some skills in the module such as HTML and laser cutting and hope to see myself improve in these
                                    by the end of the module.
